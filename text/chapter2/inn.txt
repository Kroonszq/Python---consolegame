Norr walks towards the inn and opens the door. The inn is packed with people. Everyone is drinking and having funn.
Norr finds a empty spot and sits down. on the opposite side of the table sits an old man he carries a bow with him.
The man greets Norr. What brings you here asks the man. Norr explains his situation to the man. 
Don't you have something to defend yourself with, the man asks. Norr shakes his head. The man challenges Norr to a game. 
If you win you get my knife. Norr hesitates but realizes he has nothing to lose.
