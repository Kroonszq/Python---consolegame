Chapter 4

but Norr was very confident in his ability to find a safe way. As time went along the forest became darker and 
darker until it became unnaturally dark for that time of day. And then the sounds started at first Norr thought
it was the wind rustling through the leaves then Norr started to assure himself it was the wind rustling 
through the leaves. He started seeing eyes everywhere. And then he saw the creature. 
A lot of eyes, big fangs and eight legs this was the biggest spider Norr had ever seen. 
Norr was extremely scared but needed to do something.
