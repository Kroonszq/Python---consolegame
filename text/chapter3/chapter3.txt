Chapter 3
After a couple of kilometres Norr sees a beggar sitting on the side of the road. 
Because of the rags  the beggar was clothed in Norr couldn’t see his face. 
Norr pitied the man thinking about how easy his life had been. 
He wanted to give the beggar something but didn’t know if he could miss anything on his travel.
