After the receiving the map from the wizard Norr rushed to the forest exited to have found a shortcut. 
It was a very spooky forest but Norr was very confident in his ability to find a safe way. 
As time went along the forest became darker and darker until it became unnaturally dark for that time of day. 
Norr reached for the map but couldnâ€™t find it anywhere. This was annoying but luckily he had memorised the route.
