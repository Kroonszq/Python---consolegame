After the temple is the last and the biggest climb. After a few hours of walking, Norr sees the castle farther up on the peak of the mountain.
Relieved, Norr picks up speed. Galloping they go there. After a while they come to a gorge in the mountain the last part before the castle.
Norr hears a cry of hope the moment he drives into the canyon and wonders what's going on. After a while he sees something happening in the distance.
As he gets closer and closer, he sees what's going on. Other people who come to pay their taxes are robbed by bandits.
Norr quickly jumps off his horse and hides in the corner he has to figure out what he's going to do.
