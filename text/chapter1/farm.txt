Itâ€™s the day before the first Monday of the month in the evening.
The father is laying down in bed and shouts to his son if he can come the son comes running down to him.
The dad explains his son he cant go tomorrow and that he is to sick. Cant we ask someone else to do it for us asks his son.
No says the father is to late for that now you have to go. Me ? says the boy indignantly. But dad I have never done it before.
I know son says the father but there is no other option right now.
After long consultation and many questions with his father, the boy goes to bed.
he is nervous he doesn't know if he can do it but there is no other option.

The next day he hears his mother getting the horses ready with the carts with the products for the king.
The boy gets up and changes and walks out towards the door.
but just before he goes out the door, his father calls out to him.
the boy looks around and the father says "Look out for yourself and I love you Norr" Norr nods and walks out he kisses his mother and is ready to go
