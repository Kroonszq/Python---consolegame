Norr is standing on the sun shining in his face. He gets up, saddles up his horse and continues with the mountain journey.
As it gets higher it gets colder and the oxygen in the air gets less and less. After a while, Norr sees something in the distance.
It is a very big temple. Norr raises the temple. He arrives after a few minutes. It is quiet around the temple. the air is getting warmer and the oxygen in the air is back to normal.
He has to go through the temple, but the temple has no passage. "Hello" Norr shouts. He hears nothing but then suddenly a face appears from the temple.
The face looks old and angry. The face(temple) begins to say "Dear traveler, you will enter this road if you can climb 3 councils".
